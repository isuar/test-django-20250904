# Progress Report — Django Product Certification Web App

## ✅ Completed

### Task 1: Core Models & Data Setup
- Implemented models:
  - **Customer App**: `Company`, `SupplyChainCompany`, `CertificationBody`
  - **Product App**: `ProductCategory` (with `is_active`), `RawMaterial` (with `is_active`), `Product` (with FK to `ProductCategory` and M2M to `RawMaterial`)
  - **Application App**: `Application` (with `company`, `products`, `supply_chain_companies`, `status`, timestamps, reviewer info)
- Database migrations run successfully.
- Admin registered with list filters, search, and inline editing.
- Admin verified for Customer, Product, and Application models.
- Seed data import command (`import_seed_data`) implemented with **openpyxl only** (removed pandas for Python 3.13 compatibility).

---

### Task 2: Admin Interfaces
- Product Admin: inline raw material editing inside Product form.
- Autocomplete with `django-autocomplete-light` for Product Category and Raw Materials.
- Inactive items excluded from autocomplete.
- Company & SupplyChainCompany Admin: filters and search enabled.
- Verified in admin: inline editing + autocomplete working.

---

### Task 3: Application Workflow
- **Reviewer workflow implemented**:
  - Create applications in admin linking Company, Products, and Supply Chain Companies.
  - Bulk action to recompute status.
  - Per-application **Recompute Status** and **Download PDF Report** buttons added to the change form.
- **Status logic**:
  - Pending if no products/suppliers attached.
  - Rejected if any linked product/supplier is invalid.
  - Approved if all linked items are valid.
- **PDF Export**:
  - Generates certification report listing approved Products and Supply Chain Companies.
  - Includes Product raw materials with proper comma formatting.
  - Dynamically hides Country column if no supplier has country data.
  - Basic table styling for clean, professional look.
- **Admin UX**:
  - Filters, search, date hierarchy, read-only audit fields added for Applications.
- **Performance**:
  - Query optimization in PDF view (`select_related` + `prefetch_related`) to avoid N+1 queries.

---

## ✅ Task 4 (Optional) – Excel Upload
- Added `ApplicationUpload` model to store uploaded Excel files.
- Registered **ApplicationUpload** in admin with “Process Excel” action.
- Parsing logic:
  - Reads `Company`, `Product`, `Category`, `RawMaterial`, and `Supplier`.
  - Auto-creates missing records.
  - Links them into a new `Application`.
- Fixed **redirect bug** in recompute status (removed confusing “doesn’t exist” message).
- This feature enables bulk data entry from Excel forms.

---


## 🔄 Dependency Adjustment
- Originally scaffolded with pandas.  
- Removed pandas (no wheels yet for Python 3.13 on Windows).

openpyxl==3.1.5
